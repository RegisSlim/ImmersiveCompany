# Planned:

-    More scrap.
-    New creatures.
 
# Compatibility Notes (Confirmed):
-    ENZ-LockDoorsMod
      -  Immersive company already does this. Having both will result in you being unable to interact with anything after unlocking a door.

# Compatibility Notes (Assumed):
-    MrHydralisk-EnhancedRadarBooster
      -    ImmersiveCompany overhauls the radar booster in a very similar way and might not work with this mod.
-    Silvercore-Permanent_Ladder
      -    Probably won't cause any problems but ImmersiveCompany makes the ladder permanent as well so it's a bit redundant.
